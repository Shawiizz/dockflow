Dockflow deploys your application using Docker Swarm. This section covers the deployment process, health checks, and rollback behavior.

## How Deployment Works

When you trigger a deployment, Dockflow performs the following steps:

1. **Build** - Docker images are built from your Dockerfiles
2. **Transfer** - Images are sent to your server via SSH
3. **Deploy** - The application is deployed as a Swarm stack
4. **Verify** - Health checks confirm the deployment succeeded

If health checks fail, Dockflow automatically rolls back to the previous working version.

## Triggering a Deployment

Deployments are triggered through your CI/CD pipeline:

**Tag-based deployment:**
Push a git tag to deploy that version.

```bash
git tag 1.0.0
git push origin 1.0.0
```

**Branch-based deployment:**
Push to a branch to deploy the latest commit from that branch.

```bash
git push origin main
```

The deployment environment is determined by your configuration in `.deployment/config.yml`.
