# Deployment

## Deploy with Git Tags

```bash
# Production deployment
git tag 1.0.0
git push origin --tags

# Staging deployment
git tag 1.0.0-staging
git push origin --tags

# Custom environment
git tag 1.0.0-whatever
git push origin --tags
```

## Deploy on Branch Push

Before using, you need to configure your Github/GitLab workflow.
You can also trigger deployments on direct branch pushes (deploys to `production`):

```bash
git push origin main
```

## What Happens During Deployment

1. **Build** - Docker images are built (locally or remotely)
2. **Transfer** - Images/code sent to target servers
3. **Deploy** - Ansible orchestrates the deployment
4. **Done** - Your app is live!

**CI/CD Jobs Available:**
- `build` - Validates Docker builds on every push
- `deploy` - Deploys when you push a tag
