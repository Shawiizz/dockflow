# Docker Compose

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

Standard compose file with environment variables:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: my-app
    build:
      context: ../..
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.app
    ports:
      - "${APP_PORT}:3000"
    environment:
      DB_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
      ENV: ${ENV}
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
```

<Callout type="info">
  All files in `.deployment/docker/` are automatically processed with Jinja2 templating.
</Callout>

## Environment Isolation (Automatic)

By default, `${ENV}` and `${VERSION}` are automatically added to:
- Image names
- Container names
- Volume names
- Network names

This ensures complete isolation between different environments (production, staging, etc.).
