# Build Strategy

Dockflow supports different strategies for building and transferring Docker images.

## Strategies Overview

| Strategy | Build Location | Transfer Method |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Local (default) | CI/CD runner | SSH streaming |
| Local + Registry | CI/CD runner | Docker registry |
| Remote | Server | None |

## Local Build

By default, images are built in your CI/CD pipeline and transferred to the server via SSH. No additional configuration is required.

## Registry Build

For multi-node Swarm clusters, use a Docker registry so worker nodes can pull images. See [Docker Registry](/configuration/registry) for configuration.

## Remote Build

Build images directly on the server instead of transferring them:

```yaml
# .dockflow/config.yml
options:
  remote_build: true
```

This clones your repository on the server and builds locally. Useful for large images or slow network connections.

For private repositories, add a `GIT_TOKEN` secret to your CI/CD environment.
