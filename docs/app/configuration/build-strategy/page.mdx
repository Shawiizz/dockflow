# Build Strategy

Choose how Docker images are built:

| Strategy | Where | Best For | Setup |
|----------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Local** (default) | CI/CD pipeline | Small images, fast network | Nothing to do |
| **Remote** | On server | Large images, slow network | Set `remote_build: true` |

## Enable Remote Build

Create `.deployment/config.yml`:

```yaml
options:
  remote_build: true
```

## When to Use Remote Build

Remote build is useful when:
- Your Docker images are very large (multi-GB)
- Your CI/CD network connection is slow
- You want to avoid transferring large images over the network
- Your server has better hardware for building

## How It Works

With remote build enabled:
1. The source code is transferred to the server
2. Docker builds the images directly on the server
3. No image transfer is needed
