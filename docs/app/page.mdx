Dockflow is a deployment framework that simplifies deploying Docker applications to remote servers using Docker Swarm.

## What Dockflow Does

Dockflow manages the complete deployment lifecycle:

1. Builds Docker images from your source code
2. Transfers images to your server via SSH
3. Deploys your application as a Docker Swarm stack
4. Monitors container health after deployment
5. Automatically rolls back if something goes wrong

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Debian or Ubuntu server with SSH access
- A project with a Dockerfile
- A GitHub or GitLab repository
